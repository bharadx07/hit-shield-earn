            -On your turn, you can do one of four things: Use your money to
            attack your opponent with a selection of wepons (With each one
            costing different amounts of money), Use your money to either buy
            lives or shield from anything for 1 turn, and finally buy income
            boosters (you get income after both peoples turn: $100).

            computer will make a move determined by pre-programmed logic. It is
            not coded to be super easy or super hard to beat.
